<h2>Loops</h2>
<p>We are going to use for loops, while loops, and do while loops for the following problems.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an array listing months January - June. Write the code that will display the months in order (each on a separate line) using a for loop.</li>
  <li>Create an <b>ordered</b> list of all the months with each month being a list item.
<i>  This will also use a for loop.</i></li>
  <li>Using a while loop, creat a loop that starts with 9 and runs until it reaches 2. Each time the code runs, it will say "There are <i>X</i> slices of pizza left.</li>
  <li>Using a do while loop, print out <i>Number Count:</i> and then count up from 15 to 20.<i>(Not including 20)</i>
    <li>Write a loop that will loop through numbers 5-50, counting down by 5. When it reaches today's date, however, write "That's today's date" and break out of the loop.</li>
   <li>Using a while loop again, start with 10 pizza slices and count down to 1. Each time, it will state <i>Another slice down the hatch. X left.</i> Then, when there is 1 slice left, break from the loop. Then write, <i>There is only one slice left!</i></li>
   <li>Start with 10 tickets. When there are 5 tickets left (half), write "<i>Half the tickets are sold. Buy yours NOW!</i>" Otherwise, print "<i>Another seat is gone. Only X tickets left.</i>" (X being the remaining number.) When there aren't any more tickets, write "<i>All tickets have been sold.</i>"</li>
